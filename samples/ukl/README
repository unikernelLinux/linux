UKL test program
================

tcp_server.c is a epoll based TCP echo server written in C which uses port
no. 5555 by default. syscall.S translates syscall() function to a call
instruction in assembly. Normally, C libraries provide syscall() function
that translate into syscall assembly instruction. Run `make` and it will
create a UKL.a and a tcp_server. UKL.a can then be copied to where UKL
Linux build expects it to be present. This can be changed through the Linux
config options (by running `make menuconfig` etc.) The resulting Linux
kernel can be run, and once the userspace comes up, the echo server can be
started by running the UKL exec command, again chosen through the Linux
config options. tcp_server is a userspace binary of the same echo server
which can be run normally. This is meant to show that UKL can run code
which can also be run as a userspace binary without modification.
