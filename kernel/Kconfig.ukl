menuconfig UNIKERNEL_LINUX
	bool "Unikernel Linux"
	depends on X86_64 && !RANDOMIZE_BASE && !PAGE_TABLE_ISOLATION
	help
	    Unikernel Linux allows for a single, privileged process to be
	    linked with the kernel binary and be executed inplace of or
	    along side a more traditional user space.

	    If you don't know what this is, say N.

config UKL_USE_RET
	bool "UKL use RET instead of IRET"
	depends on UNIKERNEL_LINUX
	help
	    Use a RET instruction to return to the UKL user code after a fault
	    or an interrupt.

config UKL_DEEP_SHORTCUT
	bool "Enable the UKL deep shortcutting library"
	depends on UNIKERNEL_LINUX && INET
	help
	    The UKL deep shortcutting library adds glue code for calling deep
	    into kernel subsystems, skipping kernel polymorphism. We have
	    implemented functions to call TCP send and receive using the same
	    arguments as write and read from userspace (our funcitons simply
	    do the transformations needed) but others could be added.
